Some fun and friendly projects I built while learning the basics of frontend development.

**1) XO Game**

A simple XO (Tic-Tac-Toe) game that helped me:

- Work with CSS Grid for styling
- Write responsive JavaScript code
- Handle the DOM effectively

A great beginner project to grasp essential JavaScript concepts.
